# Hybrid_Sim

Hybrid simulation of water based on the method presented in:  (https://animation.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/2015-SCA-DFSPH.pdf)
Made in the course TN1008 at LIU, the year of our lord 2016.

The project was built in visual studio 15 in c++ using the built in compiler. 

To run the simulation a few external librarys need to be included.

2 The GLM library is used for some caluclations. 
3 CompactNSearch is used for neighboor search.
